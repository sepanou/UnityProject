        Derketo is the goddess of Death, not the one of Life.\nShe could not possibly
        bring his beloved back to life \u2013 indeed, what she meant when she accepted
        Khrom\u2019s request was that he would see her back in the Afterlife."

        spell on the castle to protect the people and contain Khrom\u2019s madness
        inside Paimpont Forest."
